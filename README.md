Testing my import options between emacs and github

I'm trying to work out how I would update a package on github without having to go through all this GUI. I hope there's
something sensible, like I git commit the thing, then just run a one-liner like 'git push [gitHub project URL]',
and that gives github the up-to-date version from my own git. I'll probably have to merge it back to the master branch
afterwards, though, so... who knows.
